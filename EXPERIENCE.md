## Development Experience with Vibe Coding

Justification of Tools Chosen

I chose Cursor as the vibe coding tool for this project because it has deep integration with the development environment and keeps track of the entire codebase. Unlike typical AI assistants, in Cursor, you can have conversations directly in the editor, and it is easier to build and modify a whole application. So, that made it an ideal choice for developing a functional React-based project.

## Development Process

In development, I used Cursor to scaffold the React application using Vite and iteratively build out features from natural language prompts. I paid close attention to specifying *what* the application should do, as opposed to *how* each function should be implemented. This included key prompts like adding persistent storage with localStorage, improving user experience, and refining component structure. A few iterations were needed before it got to a point that was stable and working, which by then the AI was doing most of the boilerplate code.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main issues was when trying to make the application state persist after a page refresh. This was resolved when explicitly instructing the AI to save and load tasks from localStorage. One of the other challenges included organizing the Git branches and resolving some conflicts that had appeared between the local and remote repositories. That required manually resolving the merge issues and digging deeper into how Git works.

## Reflection Created by Knowledge One

Using a vibe coding tool completely changed my development workflow from one that focuses on writing repetitive code to one that guides the AI and reviews its output. I was surprised by the ability of AI to understand project-wide context and handle feature-level changes. Where I would use this approach in the future: rapid prototyping and small- to medium-sized applications. As vibe coding tools evolve, they are likely to shift the paradigm towards higher levels of problem solving and collaboration with AI systems in software development.
